# Key Requirements

- **3+ distinct scenes**: I have a loading, logo, and title screen.
- **2+ audio assets**: I used a walkie talki sound effect and music for the title screen.
- **2+ image assets**: I animated a logo and made the title screen.
- **2+ geometric shapes**: I use a triangle and rectangle for the loading.
- **1+ big fancy text**: I used a bold text.
- **1+ multi-line text**: I have a multi-line text
- **1+ object motion**: I have a loading bar.
